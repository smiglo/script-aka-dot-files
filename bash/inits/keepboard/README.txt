INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Java Runtime Environment, version 1.6 or newer, is needed to run Keepboard.

Run the start.sh script to launch Keepboard (you may have to grant the 'execute' permission to this file).


UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS

Exit Keepboard if it is started. Copy new version files into the existing Keepboard folder (overwrite existing files).
Keepboard saves all user data in its working folder ('history' and 'prefs' folders), so previous version data will not be lost.
